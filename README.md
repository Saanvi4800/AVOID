This python game lets you move around a character, avoiding other characters, with a main objective of securing the prize<br><br>

## Navigating
This game is pretty simple, it starts off with instructions on how this game is played. Then you are able to choose the color, shape, and speed of your charecter + difficulty of the game. Then the actual game starts. Here you have to get all of the beige colored squares (chests) in order to win. if by chance you collide with an obstacle you lose, but if you get all chests without getting hit, you win and have the option to restart the game. if yuu choose not to restart the window will just close on your screen.

## Technologies Used
Python üêç <br>

## How to Run
Unzip the file: Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a local folder on your computer.<br>
### Details:
In order to open this game, download the zip and it should open when you double click the file. If it does not, it might be because on mac it will prevent you from opening from an unidentified developer. You can bypass this if you want in privacy and security in settings. Otherwise if that does not work try opening the source code and open dist and run the game from there.

## How I made this project
I created this project becuase I wanted to further my python skills. It is the first language I learned but I plateued at coding solely in the terminal and I wanted to created something beyond the terminal. I decided to use the turtle library for this project, which I had heard of before but was mainly new to. I did struggle a lot with this project although it seems like a simple game. Creating the game itself wasn't really the hard part, it was getting user input out of the terminal. After I coded the game I hit a wall with trying to get user input through the turtle window, but eventually found a way. Buttons helped with this a lot, and connecting everything together and making sure it worked at the same time was frusterating but eventually it worked! I genuinely believe that I got a lot out of this project in terms of knowledge and I 100% will be playing this game myself.
